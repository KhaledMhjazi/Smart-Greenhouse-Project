The purpose of this project is to design and implement a simulation of a greenhouse using an Arduino Due microcontroller and various hardware components. The system is designed to track and record temperature data, maintain the temperature within a certain range, and provide a healthy light-to-darkness ratio for plants inside the greenhouse. The system also includes a calendar function to display the date and time, as well as an alarm feature to alert the user if the temperature exceeds certain limits. In addition, the system includes a fast mode option to allow for faster simulation of temperature recording and plant growth.# Smart-Greenhouse-Project
